## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd supafund-trader
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token  # Optional
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## üí° Usage

1. **Select Application**: Choose a funding application from the dropdown menu
2. **Configure Weights**: Allocate priority levels (1-5) across evaluation dimensions (max 15 total points)
3. **Generate Prediction**: Click "Generate Prediction" to run the analysis pipeline
4. **Review Results**: Examine prediction outcome, confidence score, detailed reasoning, and feature breakdown

## üîÆ How It Works

The system follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches application, project, program data, and submitted materials
